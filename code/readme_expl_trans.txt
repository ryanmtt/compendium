# This first code contains some basic exploration of the 3 datasets, and combines them all into one

# Then, motivated by the research question, the data is suitably cleaned to remove empty observations in the variables
# of interest, and other variables are removed.
# Then, the fruit column is created by combining the different fruit consumption columns, and creating an approximation
# of individuals consumption of fruit across a year

# data is then saved as finaldata.csv and put inside the clean subdirectory
