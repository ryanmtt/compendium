# This R code creates two plots of the data
# The first takes the fractional polynomial model of fruit consumption against BMI and plots it along with the raw 
# data, with fruit consumption axis on the log scale 

# Second plot shows BMI levels against fruit consumption

# these are then saved as ggplot1.png and ggplot2.png respectively in "/visualisation"
